## Library Management System

**Library Management System** (LMS) is a utility application that is developed using **JDK8** and **Java Hibernate 5.6 JPA**.  

**LMS** is intended to be used by a local libarian at a library with the idea of governing the activity of visitors.   
For example, it utilizes a **MySQL8** database  to categorize books that are in the system and have been rented.  
In addition to managing this process, librarians are free to register new users, update current user attributes, and more.  

Conclusively, it serves as an aid to my review of the Java programming language and an educational tool for learning **Java Hibernate**.
